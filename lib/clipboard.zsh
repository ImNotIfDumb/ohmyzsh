# System clipboard integration
#
# This file has support for doing system clipboard copy and paste operations
# from the command line in a generic cross-platform fashion.
#
# This is uses essentially the same heuristic as neovim, with the additional
# special support for Cygwin.
# See: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/e682d799fa3cf2e80a02d00c6ea874599d58f0e7/runtime/autoload/provider/clipboard.vim#L55-L121
